# Random Quotes
The first Treehouse tech degree project to generate random quotes based on an array of quotes.

I began this course in order to help plug the holes in my otherwise self taught programming background. I chose this Full Stack JavaScript course because it was most applicable to work I'm currently doing as a product lead.
